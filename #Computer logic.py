#Computer logic
#we have the (and, or) operators, in "and" only the truth vs. truth is true, and in OR operator only the false vs false
#is considered false.
#also there is (not) operator which turns the true to false and vice versa.


a = 9
b = 10
if a or b == 10:
    print("one of them is equal to 10")
else:
    print("A or B is not equal to 10")
